# Exercise: Create and Pitch Your Startup

## Objective

In this exercise, you will work in groups to create a startup idea and craft a compelling pitch for it. 
The exercise is designed to help you practice iterative prompt refinement.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create Your Startup (15 minutes)

1. **Brainstorming (5 minutes):**
   - Task ChatGPT with coming up with a unique idea for a startup. Instruct it to think about problems to be solved or opportunities to explore. Make it be creative!
   - Examples:
     - A platform that connects pet owners with local pet sitters.
     - A wearable device that tracks hydration levels in real time.
     - A subscription box service for personalized book recommendations.

2. **Describe Your Startup (10 minutes):**
   - Task ChatGPT with drafting a short description of your startup.
   - Consider the following questions:
     - What problem does it solve?
     - Who is your target audience?
     - What makes your solution unique?

### Step 2: Craft Your Initial Pitch (15 minutes)

1. **Initial Prompt:**
- Use ChatGPT to craft a pitch for your startup based on your description. Example prompt:
  ```
  Create a 60-second pitch for a startup called [Startup Name]. The startup solves [problem] for [target audience] by providing [solution]. Highlight its unique selling point and benefits.
  ```

### Step 3: Iteratively Improve Your Pitch (20 minutes)

1. **Review and Feedback (10 minutes):**
- Review the AI-generated pitch as a group. Ask:
  - Is the tone appropriate for your target audience?
  - Are the unique features and benefits highlighted effectively?
  - Is the message clear and engaging?
- Write down areas for improvement.

2. **Refine Your Prompt (10 minutes):**
- Adjust the prompt to include more details, specify the tone, or focus on specific aspects.
- Example Refined Prompt:
  ```
  Rewrite the pitch for Hydration Hero with a professional tone. Emphasize its advanced sensor technology and real-time tracking benefits. Keep it concise and engaging.
  ```

### Step 4: Presentation and Discussion (10 minutes)

1. **Present Your Pitch:**
- Each group will present their final pitch to the class.
- Share the steps you took to refine your prompt and improve the AI-generated pitch.

2. **Class Discussion:**
- Discuss the differences between the initial and final pitches.
- Evaluate which prompts and refinements were most effective.
- Share insights on how iterative refinement improved the overall output.


## Advice for Iterative Refinement

- **Be Specific:** Include details about tone, target audience, and unique selling points in your prompt.
- **Use Feedback:** Analyze the AI's output and identify what works and what doesnâ€™t.
- **Experiment:** Try different tones (e.g., professional, conversational, humorous) and lengths (e.g., concise vs. detailed).
- **Iterate:** Refine your prompt multiple times to see how changes affect the output.

## Bonus Challenge (Optional)

For groups that finish early:
