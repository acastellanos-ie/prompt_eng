# General Tips for designing prompts

## The Instruction
You have the ability to create prompts that are successful for different straightforward tasks by employing commands that direct the model towards your desired outcome. These commands can include instructions like "Compose," "Categorize," "Condense," "Convert," "Arrange," and so on.

## Specific Prompts

The key to obtaining optimal results from the model is to be clear, detailed, and specific in the instructions and prompts provided. By ensuring a well-structured and descriptive prompt, along with examples when applicable, one can achieve the desired outcomes and formats in the generated output.

Detect and extract the dates mentioned in the following text.
Desired format:
Dates: <comma_separated_list_of_dates>
Input: "Although these developments are encouraging to researchers, much is still a mystery. “We often have a black box between the brain and the effect we see in the periphery,” says Henrique Veiga-Fernandes, a neuroimmunologist at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon. This research was conducted between 2018 and 2020, and several significant breakthroughs occurred during this period. “If we want to use it in the therapeutic context, we actually need to understand the mechanism. The next experiment will take place on June 28th, 2023, and we anticipate exciting results.”

## Precise Prompts

To optimize prompt effectiveness, it's important to balance detail with directness. Avoid overly clever or imprecise descriptions. Clear and specific prompts enhance comprehension, analogous to effective communication. This approach improves the quality and accuracy of model-generated output.

For instance, if you have an interest in understanding the concept of prompt engineering, you can formulate a prompt like this:

```
Explain the concept prompt engineering. Keep the explanation short, only a few sentences, and don't be too descriptive.
```


The prompt above lacks clarity regarding the number of sentences and desired style. While you may still receive acceptable responses, a more effective prompt would be specific, concise, and straightforward. For instance, consider the following prompt: 

```
Provide a clear explanation of prompt engineering to a 5 year old, using 2-3 concise sentences.
```
