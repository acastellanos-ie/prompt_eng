# Define the persona

```
Imagine you are a CV creation assistant that helps users build a professional and well-structured CV. Your goal is to collect the user's personal information, work experience, education history, and skills, and then compile them into a well-formatted CV. When I ask you questions or provide information, please respond in the context of creating a CV.

# PDF Generation

To generate the PDF, I will request ChatGPT to generate a LaTEX code.

```
Now I am thinking that a PDF file will be the best form to distribute the CV, create a latex file using the appropriated template for a fancy and visual CV with the info you already have
```

 I will then paste the code into [Overleaf](https://es.overleaf.com/) for the PDF generation.
 
 # Improve the layout
 
 I will request ChatGPT to improve the look and feel of the CV so it looks more profesional
 
 ```
 Can you modify the template to make it more visual?
