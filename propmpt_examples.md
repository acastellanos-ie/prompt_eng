# Hallucination

Boie is a real company but the product is completely made up

```
Tell me about AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush by Boie
```

Apparently, we are not able to make the model to hallucinate. What happened?

```
Tell me about AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush by Boie. Don't look it up in the web
```

By forcing the model to don't use the web, it's does generate a plausible description of the product. However, it states that it might be false.

**Is that the hallucination problem is solved?**
